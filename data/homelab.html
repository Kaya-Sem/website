<body>
    <p> I once had a simple homelab. Try to imagine how it looked based on these comments I received upon showing pictures:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>
            " It is very avant-garde "
        </li>

        <li>
            " It's like I'm looking at a car crash looking at the metal and flesh, trying to make sense of things and
            trying to understand how it all used to all fit together. "
        </li>

        <li>
            " There's the mundane homelab, and then there's art. In the latter category, your server would land
            somewhere
            close to Pollock's paintings. There's some structure in it, but you have to get over the first impression.
            Keep up creating! "
        </li>

        <li>
            " It's so bad it looks like ai "
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
