    <p>Thoughts on houses and homes</p>



    <p> A house without a fireplace is not a home! </p>


    <p> good: fireplace, arches and rounded shapes, soundproofed. Single story, no stairs. Massive windows -> natural
        light. Green and
        nature.</p>

    <p> bad: a television, close neighbours.</p>



    <p>If I were to live in a city, I think I would not pay for internet. It is not needed, honestly. I believe it would
        force a nicer work/life balance. </p>
