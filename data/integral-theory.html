    <p> I think you should study Ken Wilber's integral theory.</p>

    <p>

        It is a synthetic metatheory aiming to unify a broad spectrum of Western theories and models and Eastern
        meditative
        traditions within a singular conceptual framework. The original basis, which dates to the 1970s, is the concept
        of a "spectrum of consciousness" that ranges from archaic consciousness to the highest form of spiritual
        consciousness, depicting it as an evolutionary developmental model.

    <p> If nothing else, you can use the words objective and subjective more correctly, and you get to use inter
        objective (resp. subjective), which add more nuance. </p>
